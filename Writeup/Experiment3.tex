\section*{Experiment 3}
%signal was 3.2 kHz
Differential amplifiers are often used in AC contexts, where the output voltage often has to change rapidly depending on the inputs. One case is when a unity-gain amplifier must pass a square wave. We saw in pre-lab 9 that an improved diff amp with a small capacitive load can only change \Vout so quickly, and in this experiment we tested the step response of the diff amp to both large and small steps, with a $1 nf$ capacitive load parallel to the feedback loop. We saw that given a small step, \Vout takes a first-order approach to \Vin, and extracted time constants for both the up- and down-swings. We also saw that given a large step, \Vout approaches \Vin linearly, and we extracted values for the slew rate for both the up- and down-swings.

\subsection*{Small Signal Analysis}

% Is the response symmetrical? Does the ampliﬁer exhibit approximately
% linear behavior? Extract a time constant both for the up-going and for the down-going
% output transitions. How do these compare with that which you compute from the measured
% values of the load capacitance and the differential-mode transconductance gain that you
% found in Experiment 2? In your report, include a single plot showing both scope traces
% along with the extracted time constants.

We first started by sending a $3.2 kHz$ square wave into the unity-gain follower, with a peak to peak voltage of

\subsection*{Large Signal Analysis}

% Is the response symmetrical? You will probably notice that the output
% of the ampliﬁer follows a linear trajectory in time over most of its response to the large input
% step. This behavior is called slewing, and the constant rate of change of the output voltage
% with respect to time is called the slew rate of the ampliﬁer. Extract a slew rate for both for
% the up-going and for the down-going output transitions. How do these compare with those
% which you compute from the load capacitance and the limiting values of the output current?
% In your report, include a single plot showing both scope traces along with the extracted slew
% rates.
