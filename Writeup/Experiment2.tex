\section*{Experiment 2}

For a single value of the inverting input voltage, we then swept the
noninverting input around the inverting one while measuring \Vout. We then fit
a straight line to the steep portion of the curve in order to determine the
differential-mode voltage (\Adm) gain of the circuit. The experimental results,
along with the differential mode gain fit to the curve is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:exp2p1}.

From the experimental data, we found $A_{dm} \approx 110$

Next, we set the differential-mode input voltage to zero and measured the
current flowing into the output of the amplifer as we swept \Vout from one
rail to the other. We fit a straight line to the shallow part of this output
currentâ€“voltage characteristic in order to determine the incremental output
resistance of the circuit. The voltage transfer characteristic in this region
can be seen below in Figure \ref{fig:exp2p2}.
From the linear fit, we extracted an incremental output resistance of $489.6k\Omega$

include a plot showing the output current-voltage characteristic along with the best-fit line.
