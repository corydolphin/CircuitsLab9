\section*{Experiment 2}

For a single value of the inverting input voltage, we then swept the
non-inverting input around the inverting one while measuring \Vout. We then fit
a straight line to the steep portion of the curve in order to determine the
differential-mode voltage (\Adm) gain of the circuit. The experimental results,
along with the differential mode gain fit to the curve is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:exp2p1}.

From the experimental data, we found $A_{dm} \approx 110$

Next, we set the differential-mode input voltage to zero and measured the
current flowing into the output of the amplifier as we swept \Vout from one
rail to the other. We fit a straight line to the shallow part of this output
currentâ€“voltage characteristic in order to determine the incremental output
resistance of the circuit. The voltage transfer characteristic in this region
can be seen below in Figure \ref{fig:exp2p2}.
From the linear fit, we extracted an incremental output resistance of $489.6k\Omega$.

Next, we fixed the output voltage at $2.5V$ and measured the current flowing
out of the amplifier as we swept \Vdm around zero. We then fit a straight line
to the curve around where $V_{dm} = 0$ in order to extract the incremental
transconductance gain of the circuit.  This voltage transfer characteristic 
can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:exp2p3}.
From the linear fit, we extracted an incremental transconductance gain of $2.3687 \times 10^{-4} \Omega^{-1}$

In this experiment, we found the limiting values of $I_{out}$ to be $+ 66.69 \mu A$, and $-70.01 \mu A$, fairly symmetric on both rails. 

We then calculated the differential-mode gain of the circuit by computing
the product of \Gm and \Ro.
$$A_{dm`} =  2.3687 \times 10^{-4} \Omega^{-1} \cdot 489.6k\Omega = 115.477$$
This theoretical differential-mode gain is slightly higher than our extracted
value, of $110$. This represents a relative percent error of roughly $4.9\%$.

In comparison to our previous lab's VTC and \Adm value, this circuit is a much better amplifier. It not only can achieve a larger range of output voltages, with a rail-to-rail swing, but the differential-mode-gain is almost twice that of Lab 8's amplifier. In Lab 8, we found $A_{dm} = 62.4146$. Thus this amplifier is far more reactive to small changes in voltage and would be more useful in the real world!
